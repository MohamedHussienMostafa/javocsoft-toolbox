=================

Android commons utility library.

This library contains a set of useful functions, classes and modules ready to use.

This project is a library for Android. While i was making my own projects i always tried to reuse the written code so i created this library. Today i have decided to share it with all. The idea is to make easier programming for Android :)

Contains a set of utility classes, the most important called "ToolBox", with a set of quite large collection of different functions ready to be used just by including this library in your project.

We have the ToolBox.java main class but also there are other utility classes and modules:

* Encoding utilities that i use (B64)
* Class "MediaScannerNotifier.java" that allows to add easily a resource to the Android content scanner.
* A class called "Unzipper.java" allowing us to work with ZIP files in a easy way.
* The class "SMSObserver.java" to be able to be aware of sent/received SMS in the mobile.
* The class "CMTShortNumberInformation.java" that allows to recognize if a short number is one of the CMT recognized additional tarification number (like SMS Premium).
* The class "HttpOperations.java" that allows to make HTTP POST/GET request easily.
* A Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) module. very easy and fast to use and integrate in your project to allow receiving push notifications from your application.

This library is under development because i use it for all my projects so i am all time adding new features :).


Greetings and i hope it will save time in your projects as it does for me.
